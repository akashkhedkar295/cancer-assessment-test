            <h1>What is bladder cancer? A Mayo Clinic expert explains</h1><br>
            <p>Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that begins in the cells of the bladder. The bladder is a hollow muscular
            organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine.</p>
            <p>Bladder cancer most often begins in the cells (urothelial cells) that line the inside of your bladder. Urothelial cells
            are also found in your kidneys and the tubes (ureters) that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Urothelial cancer can
            happen in the kidneys and ureters, too, but it's much more common in the bladder.</p>
            <p>Most bladder cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, when the cancer is highly treatable. But even early-stage bladder
            cancers can come back after successful treatment. For this reason, people with bladder cancer typically need follow-up
            tests for years after treatment to look for bladder cancer that recurs.</p>

            <h1>What Is Breast Cancer?</h1><br>
            <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer.
            The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.</p>
            <p>Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast. A breast is made up of three main parts: lobules, ducts, and
            connective tissue. The lobules are the glands that produce milk. The ducts are tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The
            connective tissue (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds everything together. Most breast
            cancers begin in the ducts or lobules.</p>
            <p>Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When breast cancer spreads to other
            parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized.</p><br>
            <h1>Kinds of Breast Cancer</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Invasive ductal carcinoma.</b> The cancer cells begin in the ducts and then grow outside the ducts into other parts of the
                breast tissue. Invasive cancer cells can also spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body.</li>
                <li><b>Invasive lobular carcinoma.</b> Cancer cells begin in the lobules and then spread from the lobules to the breast tissues
                that are close by. These invasive cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>What Is Colorectal Cancer?</h1>
            <p>Colorectal cancer starts in the colon or the rectum. These cancers can also be called colon cancer or rectal cancer,
            depending on where they start. Colon cancer and rectal cancer are often grouped together because they have many features
            in common.</p>
            <h1>The colon and rectum</h1>
            <p>To understand colorectal cancer, it helps to know about the normal structure and function of the colon and rectum.</p>
            <p>The colon and rectum make up the large intestine (or large bowel), which is part of the digestive system, also called
            the gastrointestinal (GI) system (see illustration below).</p>
            <p>Most of the large intestine is made up of the colon, a muscular tube about 5 feet (1.5 meters) long. The parts of the
            colon are named by which way the food is traveling through them.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>The first section is called the ascending colon. It starts with a pouch called the cecum, where undigested food comes in
                from the small intestine. It continues upward on the right side of the abdomen (belly).</li>
                <li>The second section is called the transverse colon. It goes across the body from the right to the left side.</li>
                <li>The third section is called the descending colon because it descends (travels down) on the left side.</li>
                <li>The fourth section is called the sigmoid colon because of its “S” shape. The sigmoid colon joins the rectum, which then
                connects to the anus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The ascending and transverse sections together are called the proximal colon. The descending and sigmoid colon are
            called the distal colon.</p>
            <h1>How do the colon and rectum work?</h1>
            <p>The colon absorbs water and salt from the remaining food matter after it goes through the small intestine (small bowel).
            The waste matter that's left after going through the colon goes into the rectum, the final 6 inches (15cm) of the
            digestive system. It's stored there until it passes through the anus. Ring-shaped muscles (also called a sphincter)
            around the anus keep stool from coming out until they relax during a bowel movement.</p>

        <div class="tabcontent" id="Kidney-Cancer">
            <h1>What is kidney cancer? An expert explains</h1><br>
            <p>Kidney cancer is cancer that begins in the kidneys. Your kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your
            fist. They're located behind your abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of your spine.</p>
            <p>In adults, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer. Other less common types of kidney cancer can
            occur. Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms' tumor.</p>
            <p>The incidence of kidney cancer seems to be increasing. One reason for this may be the fact that imaging techniques such
            as computerized tomography (CT) scans are being used more often. These tests may lead to the accidental discovery of
            more kidney cancers. Kidney cancer is often discovered at an early stage, when the cancer is small and confined to the
            kidney.</p>

                <li>Blood in your urine, which may appear pink, red or cola colored</li>
